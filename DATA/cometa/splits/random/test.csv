6496	calcium	Calcium	5540006	Calcium	5540006	There are many different forms of magnesium , Magnesium threonate is best for those with brain issues ( it gets into the brain more effectively ) however it is the most expensive and has the lowest magnesium density so it may make sense to use a combination of the cheap and effective magnesium citrate powder in water , with magnesium glycinate / bisglycinate , or magnesium malate or taurate as other options depending how which works out most cost effective . When vitamin d levels climb to or above 40ng / ml 100nmol / l absorption of calcium is increased and so the need for calcium supplements or calcium fortified foods is diminished and could become potentially hazardous at higher levels so keep and eye on calcium intakes and levels particularly after a year or more of high dose vitamin d3 daily .	https://www.reddit.com/9qfhzz	./stage_1/Batch 1E-Ready.xlsx
