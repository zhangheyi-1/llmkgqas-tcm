Test module for testing yaml tools, MindFormerConfig.

How to run this:
windows:  pytest .\\tests\\st\\test_yaml.py
linux:  pytest ./tests/st/test_yaml.py

Note:
    the name of model yaml file should start with model.
    the name of model ckpt file should be same with yaml file.
example:
    clip_vit_b_32.yaml starts with clip,
    and clip_vit_b_32.ckpt is model ckpt file.
